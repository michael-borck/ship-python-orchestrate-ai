# Ship Python, Orchestrate AI

This repository contains the source for the book "Ship Python, Orchestrate AI: Professional Python in the AI Era" - a comprehensive guide to professional Python development practices.

## About the Book

Modern Python development demands more than just writing functional code. This book presents a complete development pipeline that balances simplicity with professional practices, helping developers at all levels build maintainable, production-ready Python projects.

### Key Topics

- Setting up proper project structure and version control
- Managing dependencies effectively
- Using code quality tools (linting, formatting, static analysis)
- Implementing testing strategies with pytest
- Adding type checking to Python projects
- Creating effective documentation
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines
- Packaging and distribution

The book follows a "crawl-walk-run" approach, starting with essential practices and progressively introducing more advanced techniques.
